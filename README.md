# React Training 2022

This repository was built to house some of the test projects I built in 2022 after finishing Team Trehouse's 9 hour [Learn React Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-react). More recently done some more coursework that is housed in my [Modern React](https://github.com/kevin-mcdaniel/ModernReact/tree/main) repository.
